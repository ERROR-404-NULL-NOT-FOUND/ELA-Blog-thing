Mission statement:
To be "the computer person"

Biographical paragraph:
I've lived in Texas my entire life, being born in Austin and moving to Dripping Springs in the summer before my 5th grade year.
My parents figured out that I was very tech-oriented from a very young age, since I (somehow) managed to take apart an electronic picture frame at the age of 5.
After that point, I sort of just screwed around with electronics when I had the opportunity, until the end of my 5th grade year, when COVID-19 hit.
Since I was on the computer a lot during lockdown, I figured out that I really like screwing around with computers, and I started doing so.
Around christmas 2020, I installed Linux for the first time, and fell in love with it immediately.
From then on, screwing with computers became my main hobby.
It's gotten to the point that I now own a $4,000 server that I use for web hosting, email hosting, and MC server hosting.

My animal symbol is the owl, the symbol of Athena and intelligence.
