  <h3>How I got my server and specs</h3>
  <p>
    I'll just touch on this briefly, but I got my server for free from the co-owner of Pi-Architects (Architectural firm), Mr. Warrick.
    The server itself is a Dell Poweredge T630, and the specs are as follows:<br><br>Dual Intel Xeon E5-2620 v3 (24 cores in total)<br>64 gb DDR4 ram<br>24 tb raw storage, 20x600 gb 10k rpm hard drives, 2x600 gb 15k hard drives (raid 1 boot), 8x1.2 tb 10k hard drives
  </p>
  <h3>OS and initial setup</h3>
  <p>
     The first thing I had to do when I set up my server was wipe the drives, as I was contractually obligated to do so.
    After like 8 hours, the drives were wiped, and I could move on to installing a distro.
    Before I installed a distro, I had to pick one.
    This part was tricky, since there were a lot of options, and I'll list a few of them here:
    <ul>
      <li>Alpine</li>
      <li>Debian 11 stable</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Server</li>
      <li>Arch</li>
    </ul>I ended up settling on Debian 11 stable, mostly due to me knowing how to use Debian, and not really wanting to deal with removing Snap from Ubuntu Server.<br>The installation/initial setup process was pretty painless, the hardest thing that I had to do was setting up ZFS with 28 drives (ended up ripping out 20 of them due to the immense power draw).
  </p>
  <h3>Setting up docker</h3>
  <p>
    So, the first thing to do after initial setup was install docker.
    This part was more painful than I anticipated, since Debian Stable's repos are so out-of-date.
    I ended up going to the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/debian/">docker website</a> and copy-pasted the commands from there
