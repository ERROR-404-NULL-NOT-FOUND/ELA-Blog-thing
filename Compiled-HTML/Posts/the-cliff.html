<p>ELA Period 1<br>Pousson<br>9 September 2022</p>
<p> The date was...idk some time in late 2020.<br>I was 13.<br>I was at Perdinalis falls.<br>I saw a cliff, it was around 30 feet tall.<br>"Finally", I thought to myself, "A worthy challenge".<br>I made it to the top easily enough, but then it came time to climb back down, and I realized that I had made a terrible mistake.<br>I had just climbed up a vertical cliff, but as anyone who has climbed before knows, going up is a lot easier than coming down.<br>As I stood there, on the ledge, staring down at a drop that seemed to get further by the moment, my dad came over and tried to help me down.<br>My dad is tall, but not 30 feet tall, so what did we do?<br>We recruited another dad!<br>With their combined height...They still weren't anywhere near me.<br>"So, it has come to this," I thought, "I must actually try to climb down on my own".<br>And so I started my decent.<br>It was pretty tough, and I had to go through a couple thorn bushes, but I ended up just above their heads.<br>Now, why didn't I go lower?<br>The cliff face dropped away right below that, and a 6 foot drop is anything but comfortable.<br>We then struggled for a while, until finally they managed to get me down.<br>I learned absolutely nothing from this, and got stuck in a tree about an hour later.</p><span><div class="footer"><p>Website designed and written by Tetra Green, this website is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt">GPL 3.0</a>.
